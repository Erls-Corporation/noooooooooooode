  content: An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova barrels down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front seat are two young fellas -- one white, one black -- both wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters. Their names are Vincent Vega (white) and Jules Winnfield (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

  actor: Vincent
  line: What so you want to know?
- action: speak
  actor: Jules
  line: Well, hash is legal there, right?
- action: speak
  actor: Vincent
  line: Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.

  actor: Jules
  line: Those are hash bars?
- action: speak
  actor: Vincent
  line: "Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause -- get a load of this -- if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you. Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have."

  line: Examples?
- action: speak
  actor: Vincent
  line: Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. And I don't mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar. In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald's. Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
- action: speak
  actor: Jules
