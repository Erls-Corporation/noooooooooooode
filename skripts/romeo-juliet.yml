- action: speak
  actor: Juliet
  line: This doth not so, for she divideth us.
- action: speak
  actor: Juliet
  line: Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;
- action: speak
  actor: Juliet
  line: O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,
- action: speak
  actor: Juliet
  line: Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
- action: speak
  actor: Juliet
  line: Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!
- action: speak
  actor: Juliet
  line: O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.
- action: speak
